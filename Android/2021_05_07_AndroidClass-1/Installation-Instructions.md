# Android Studio Installation Instructions

- Download the Android Studio installer from here: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- <b>Follow this instructions:</b> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H53e2kdaLfk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H53e2kdaLfk)

## <b>NOTE:</b>

1. Keep you computer connected to the internet during the installation and also while creating new project.

2. During the <b>Android SDK setup</b> (comes at first launch of Android Studio), choose "Custom Install" (as done in video).
3. At this screen

    confirm that the `Android SDK Location` doesn't contain any space.

    e.g., `C:\Users\nishchal sid\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` is not correct as it has space in it (this will occur only when your Windows username has space). In such case change the location of SDK to something like `C:\AndroidSDK` to resolve the problem.
4. You can skip the installation of Intel HAXM and Android Virtual Device (as done in the above video) and instead use your smartphone for debugging the apps. This is also faster and safer, as Emulator is resource hungry. We will also be using our smartphone for debugging during teaching.
5. Ensure you have done the setup as per the video before the class as it will take close to 2GB of internet data.
